I used to read constantly. Through school, through college, through my early twenties—books were the main way I spent free time.

Then I got a smartphone, and I stopped. Not overnight, but gradually. The phone was always closer and lighter. Social media scratched the same itch with less friction. Books started to feel slow.

Last year I read 31 books. Here's what actually helped.

## Kill the Phone in Bed

The single most effective change: I stopped bringing my phone into the bedroom.

I bought a cheap alarm clock. My phone charges in another room overnight. The first week was uncomfortable—I'd reach for it out of habit and find nothing there. After that, it got easier. Now I read before bed because there's nothing else to reach for.

This works because reading and phone-scrolling compete for the same slot: the wind-down hour before sleep. Remove the phone and reading fills the space naturally.

## Keep a Book Everywhere

I keep books in weird places. Bathroom. Kitchen counter. My bag. Work desk.

The goal is zero activation energy. When I have five minutes, I don't have to go get the book—it's already there. Those five-minute sessions add up. I've finished dozens of books in stolen minutes.

## Quit Books Freely

For years I'd force myself through books I wasn't enjoying because I'd started them. The sunk cost fallacy, applied to reading.

Now I quit without guilt. Life is short and the to-read list is infinite. If a book isn't working, I put it down. Sometimes I come back to it later and love it. Sometimes I don't.

Giving myself permission to quit made me enjoy reading more, not less. I stopped dreading the books I'd committed to and started looking forward to the ones I actually wanted to read.

## Don't Track Too Hard

Reading challenges and Goodreads goals work for some people. They made me miserable.

I'd find myself picking short books to hit a number, or rushing through something interesting to mark it done. The metric became the goal instead of the reading.

I track loosely now—I keep a list, but I don't set targets. The reading happens because I enjoy it, not because I'm chasing a number.

None of this is revolutionary. But reading more wasn't a complex problem. It was a default problem—I'd defaulted to screens, and I needed to change the default.

The phone in another room was most of it.
