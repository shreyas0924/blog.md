The most productive thing I do most weeks is a ten-minute conversation with a colleague.

Not a meeting. Not a brainstorm. Just a conversation where I explain what I'm stuck on. And almost always, before they even respond, I've figured out the answer.

This is Rubber Duck Debugging, the practice of explaining a problem to an inanimate object to surface your own assumptions. But the version with a human has a bonus: sometimes they actually have the answer.

## Why We Don't Ask

There are real costs to asking for help. It takes someone's time. It reveals that you don't know something. It requires you to admit you're stuck.

But we consistently overestimate these costs.

The time cost is usually small—most questions resolve in under five minutes. The vulnerability is usually welcomed—nobody thinks less of you for asking, and they often feel trusted that you asked them. The admission of being stuck is honest, and honesty is underrated in engineering culture.

What we underestimate is the cost of *not* asking: hours lost down rabbit holes, momentum killed by low-confidence decisions, solutions built on flawed assumptions.

## The Question Is the Answer

When you force yourself to articulate a problem clearly enough to ask about it, you do most of the work.

Good questions require:
- Understanding the context well enough to explain it
- Identifying what you actually don't know
- Ruling out the obvious solutions

That process of formulation often yields the answer before you've asked anyone.

## Ask Sooner

My rule of thumb: if I've been stuck on the same problem for more than an hour, I ask someone.

Not because they'll necessarily know the answer. But because the act of asking resets my perspective. I stop being the person inside the problem and become the person explaining it. The shift is small and it makes all the difference.

The blocker in your way right now, the thing you've been circling for days—it will probably dissolve the moment you say it out loud.

So just ask.
